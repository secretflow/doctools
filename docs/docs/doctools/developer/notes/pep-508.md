# PEP 508 and Rye Workspace

Rye has a [workspace](https://rye-up.com/guide/pyproject/#toolryeworkspace) feature that allows you to manage multiple projects in a single repository. This is useful for monorepos and other situations where you have multiple projects that you want to manage together.

Unfortunately, unlike NPM/Yarn/PNPM workspaces, **it is not currently possible for workspace packages to depend on each other.** This is because [**PEP 508**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/) does not allow relative paths, and Rye uses pip, which strictly conforms to PEP 508, to resolve dependencies. See [pypa/pip#6658](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6658).

PEP 508 allows only URIs in package specifiers, such as VCS (`git+ssh://...`) and local (`file:///...`) URLs. URIs must conform to [**RFC 3986**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), and `file:` URIs must conform to [**RFC 8089**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8089), where the path must be absolute, leaving no room for relative paths.

Right now, if you try to `rye add` a local dependency, the resulting package specifier in `pyproject.toml` will be an absolute `file:` URL, and is not portable:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[project]
dependencies = [
  "package @ file:///Users/you/path/to/workspace/and/package",
]
```

Hatch has a ["context formatting"](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/dependency/#local) feature, where you can write `"<NAME> @ {root:uri}/../pkg_alongside_project"`, but Rye does not use this.

Attempting to write your own package specifiers results in pip rejecting all of these:

| Specifier              | Reason                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./path/to/dep`        | Not a URI                                                                                                                                       |
| `file:./path/to/dep`   | Not a valid RFC 3986 URI                                                                                                                        |
| `file://./path/to/dep` | Doesn't do what you think it does. According to RFC 8089 (and urllib.parse), this points to a resource on the host `.` with path `/path/to/dep` |

:::info
pip supports the form `file:./relative/path` on the command line and in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
$ pip install file:lib/package
Processing lib/package
  Installing build dependencies ... done
  ...
```

But not in `pyproject.toml`, apparently.

It is truly amazing how much of a mess dependency resolution in Python is.

## Workarounds

There are no workarounds. We are sticking to one directory for our entire Python package for now.
