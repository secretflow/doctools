    - strong: runtime
    - text: . The frontend compiler accepts an ML program as input and converts it into an
    - strong: MPC-specific intermediate representation
    - text: . After a series of delicate code optimizations, programs will be executed by a performant backend runtime as MPC protocols. Based on SPU, we can run ML programs of different frameworks with minor modifications in a privacy-preserving manner.
