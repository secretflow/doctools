Tables
------

For grid tables, you have to “paint” the cell grid yourself. They look like this:

+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| (header rows optional) |            |          |          |
+========================+============+==========+==========+
| body row 1, column 1   | column 2   | column 3 | column 4 |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| body row 2             | ...        | ...      |          |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+

Simple tables are easier to write, but limited: they must contain more than one row, and the first column cells cannot contain multiple lines. They look like this:

=====  =====  =======
A      B      A and B
=====  =====  =======
False  False  False
True   False  False
False  True   False
True   True   True
=====  =====  =======

:Indentation: Since the field marker may be quite long, the second
   and subsequent lines of the field body do not have to line up
   with the first line, but they must be indented relative to the
   field name marker, and they must line up with each other.
:Parameter i: integer


term 1
    Definition 1.

term 2
    Definition 2, paragraph 1.

    Definition 2, paragraph 2.

term 3 : classifier
    Definition 3.

term 4 : classifier one : classifier two
    Definition 4.

-a         Output all.
-c arg     Output just arg.
--long     Output all day long.
/V         A VMS/DOS-style option.

-p         This option has two paragraphs in the description.
           This is the first.

           This is the second.
           Blank lines may be omitted between options
           (as above) or left in (as here and below).

--very-long-option  A VMS-style option.  Note the adjustment
                    for the required two spaces.

--an-even-longer-option
           The description can also start on the next line.

-2, --two  This option has two variants.

-f FILE, --file=FILE  These two options are synonyms; both have
                      arguments.

-f <[path]file>  Option argument placeholders must start with
                 a letter or be wrapped in angle brackets.

-d <src dest>    Angle brackets are also required if an option
                 expects more than one argument.

Blocks
------

This is a typical paragraph.  An indented literal block follows::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print "it's..."
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends

This text has returned to the indentation of the first paragraph,
is outside of the literal block, and is therefore treated as an
ordinary paragraph.

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

    | A one, two, a one two three four
    |
    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?
    |
    | Singing...

This is an ordinary paragraph.

>>> print 'this is a Doctest block'
this is a Doctest block

The following is a literal block::

    >>> This is not recognized as a doctest block by
    reStructuredText.  It *will* be recognized by the doctest
    module, though!
