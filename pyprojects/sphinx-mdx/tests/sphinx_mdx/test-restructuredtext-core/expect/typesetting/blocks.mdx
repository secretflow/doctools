# Literal Blocks

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there `-->`).  They can be indented:

```default
if literal_block:
    text = 'is left as-is'
    spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
    markup_processing = None
```

Or they can be quoted without indentation:

```default
>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?
```

# Line Blocks

<LineBlock>
  This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.

  <LineBlock>
    Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").

    Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
  </LineBlock>

  Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.

  <LineBlock>
    The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
    the left edge of the text above it.
  </LineBlock>
</LineBlock>

<LineBlock>
  This is a second line block.

  <br />

  Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".
</LineBlock>

# Block Quotes

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

> as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
> end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
> far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
