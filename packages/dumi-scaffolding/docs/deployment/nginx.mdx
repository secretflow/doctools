# nginx

[nginx](https://nginx.org/) is a fast, production level HTTP server. When serving your
application with one of the WSGI servers listed in [Deploying to Production](index.mdx), it is
often good or necessary to put a dedicated HTTP server in front of it.
This “reverse proxy” can handle incoming requests, TLS, and other
security and performance concerns better than the WSGI server.

Nginx can be installed using your system package manager, or a pre-built
executable for Windows. Installing and running Nginx itself is outside
the scope of this doc. This page outlines the basics of configuring
Nginx to proxy your application. Be sure to read its documentation to
understand what features are available.

:target{#domain-name}

## Domain Name

Acquiring and configuring a domain name is outside the scope of this
doc. In general, you will buy a domain name from a registrar, pay for
server space with a hosting provider, and then point your registrar
at the hosting provider’s name servers.

To simulate this, you can also edit your <code>hosts</code> file, located at
<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Linux. Add a line that associates a name with the
local IP.

Modern Linux systems may be configured to treat any domain name that
ends with <code>.localhost</code> like this without adding it to the <code>hosts</code>
file.

    <code>/etc/hosts</code>

  ```python
  127.0.0.1 hello.localhost
  ```

:target{#configuration}

## Configuration

The nginx configuration is located at <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> on
Linux. It may be different depending on your operating system. Check the
docs and look for <code>nginx.conf</code>.

Remove or comment out any existing <code>server</code> section. Add a <code>server</code>
section and use the <code>proxy\_pass</code> directive to point to the address the
WSGI server is listening on. We’ll assume the WSGI server is listening
locally at <code>http\://127.0.0.1:8000</code>.

<figure id="id3">
  <figcaption>
    <code>/etc/nginx.conf</code>
  </figcaption>

  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name _;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /;
      }
  }
  ```
</figure>

Then [Tell Werkzeug it is Behind a Proxy](proxy_fix.mdx) so that your application uses these headers.

:target{#static-files}

## Static Files

If your application has static files such as JavaScript, CSS, and
images, it will be more efficient to let Nginx serve them directly
rather than going through the Python application.

Assuming the static files are expected to be available under the
<code>/static/</code> URL, and are stored at <code>/home/project/static/</code>, add the
following to the <code>server</code> block above.

```nginx
location /static {
    alias /home/project/static;
}
```
